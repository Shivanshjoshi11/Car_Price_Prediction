# Car_Price_Prediction
In the year 2017, India had 253 million cars running on it's road. Amazing right? We Indians surely love driving, so much that we don't say "Lets go", we say "Gaadi tera bhai chalayega (Your broz gonna drive today)". 

So India is surely a very huge market for car manufacturers, so huge that it has been predicted that it is expected to reach US$ 251.4-282.8 billion by the year 2026. 

In this project I have used a dataset from kaggle  [(Link for the dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/colearninglounge/used-cars-price-prediction) . The dataset had 15 features ranging from the car name to the number of seats in the car. I had to do a lot of data preprocessing to make the data usable.
